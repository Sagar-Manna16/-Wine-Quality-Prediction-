# -Wine-Quality-Prediction-
"Developing a model to predict wine quality based on various features and characteristics."
This repository contains a project focused on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the quality of wine based on various features and characteristics. To achieve this, we leverage a dataset containing information about different wines and their corresponding quality ratings.
The core component of this project is the wine_quality_prediction.ipynb notebook, which you can open in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE of your choice. The notebook contains detailed instructions and code cells that guide you through the process of training the wine quality prediction model. By executing the code sequentially, you will train the model using the provided dataset and evaluate its performance.

In addition to the main functionality, this repository includes guidelines on contributing to the project. We welcome contributions, bug reports, and suggestions for improvement. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for enhancing the project, please create an issue on the GitHub repository. Furthermore, you are encouraged to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your proposed changes.

Models
